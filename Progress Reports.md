**Recent Progress Reports**

Accomplishments for This Reporting Period:

-coded form correctly to input information in database. 

-Database structured in the same manner as the web form in cases of variables.


Accomplishments Planned but Not Completed This Reporting Period:

-Form cosmetics, I intended to make form more graphically pleaseing but I could not get what I was looking for so left in a minimalistic form.

Root Cause of Variances: 

-Still having issues retrieving data from database

-I could never get my web form to communicate effectively with my database platform. I think that my coding is correct within my webform to submit data to the database.

Planned Corrective or Preventive Action:

-I would look into a different database management tool that works better with my web developer. Someinthg like using ASP.net to go to the Microsoft server manager I used or phpMyadmin to be all inclusive fo a project of this nature.
